---

## 🔴 Needs Your Action (Cannot be done in code)

| # | Item | Where |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | **Twilio credentials** | Fix invalid keys in Vercel → phone readings return 20101 error on every load |
| A2 | **Stripe Connect webhook** | Stripe Dashboard → Webhooks → add `account.updated` event |
| A3 | **AYRSHARE_API_KEY** | Vercel env vars → activates social auto-posting cron |
| A4 | **OG social image** | Design a 1200×630 branded card → `/public/images/home/og-card.jpg` |
| A5 | **NEXT_PUBLIC_TABBY_USERNAME** | Vercel env vars → set to Tabby's AstrologyPro username → activates graduation CTA |
| A6 | **Tabby's Google Calendar** | Connect via `/api/calendar/connect` → unblocks E3-S5 consultation booking |
| A7 | **Stripe product IDs** | Vercel env vars → `STRIPE_PRICE_COMMUNITY_INDIVIDUAL`, `STRIPE_PRICE_COMMUNITY_FAMILY`, `STRIPE_PRICE_MYSTERY_ENROLLMENT`, `STRIPE_PRICE_MYSTERY_MONTHLY` |
| A8 | **Foundation week content** | Admin → /admin/mystery-school → add 12 weeks (title, content, audio URL, Beto photo URL) |
| A9 | **Decan ritual steps** | Admin → /admin/mystery-school/decans → seed ritual steps for all 36 decans |
| A10 | **Holy book PDFs** | Upload to Supabase Storage → add URLs via admin /community/library |

---

## 🟠 High Priority (Code work remaining)

| # | Task | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| H1 | **OG image path update** | Once OG card is designed, update `layout.tsx` `OG_IMAGE` constant |

---

## 🟡 Normal Priority

| # | Task | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| N1 | **Phone readings — full E2E test** | Once Twilio creds fixed: test inbound call → queue → diviner answers → billing |
| N2 | **Ayrshare — full E2E test** | Once API key added: test social post creation + cron auto-posting |
| N3 | **SES domain verification** | Monitor DNS propagation; test email delivery once verified |
| N4 | **Community Stripe products** | Create products in Stripe Dashboard → set env vars (A7 above) |

---

## 🟢 Backlog / Ideas

- Mobile app (React Native)
- Diviner discovery page improvements (filters, search)
- Client-facing self-serve cancellation with auto-refund
- Angular bundle optimisation (E10-S3)
- Angular duplicate AuthService cleanup (E1-S3)
- Angular TypeScript model interfaces (E1-S4)

| Fix | Detail |

## ✅ Completed This Session (session 8 — 2026-04-03)

| Fix | Detail |
|---|---|
| Phone billing re-enabled | `if (false)` → `if (client.stripe_customer_id && client.default_payment_method_id)` — schema was blocking it |
| Migration 000010 applied | `clients.stripe_customer_id` + `clients.default_payment_method_id` added to production |
| Settings/Profile/Live blank screens | All 3 had silent `return null` on DB failure; now show error + Reload button |
| Content Library tab | Was showing 6 hardcoded fake cards forever; now fetches real content from `/api/marketing/content` |
| Marketing content file upload | "Choose File" button had no `<input type="file">` — wired with drag-drop + file name display |
| Caption preview username | Was hardcoded "CosmicReader"; now fetches real diviner username via new `/api/diviners/me` |
| `/api/diviners/me` | New route returning username, displayName, avatarUrl for client components |
| `/api/marketing/subscribe` | Was `console.log` only; now upserts to `blog_subscribers` table with `source: "marketing"` |
| Blog "Notify me" pill | Was unstyled plain text; now `<a href="#subscribe">` with hover state |
| `api/debug` deleted | Was publicly exposing Stripe key prefix + all price IDs — security hole |
| Migration 000009 applied | 13 missing FK indexes across 7 tables (affiliate_referrals, gift_certificates, phone_sessions, etc.) |
| Booking wizard toast | Slot fetch failure was silent; now shows `toast.error()` |
| Portal recording link | `recording_share_id IS NOT NULL` filter added — prevented `/session/null/recording` |
| Stripe webhook promise | Google Calendar event ID update was inside orphaned `.then(() => {})` — fixed to chain properly |
| Favicon set complete | SVG design + 7 PNG sizes + proper ICO (multi-res binary format) + site.webmanifest + layout.tsx wired |
| Migrations automated | All migrations now applied via `scripts/run-migration.js` — no manual SQL editor needed |

---

| Fix | Detail |
|---|---|
| Vercel linked + 18 env vars pushed | Including CRON_SECRET, ADMIN_EMAILS, AWS SES vars |
